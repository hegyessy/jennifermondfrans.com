Title: Landscapes on paper

----

About:

Landscapes from Paia, Maui, where I visited in January 2017. Inspired from views of the oceanfront bungalow where I stayed, to the scenery of walking the mile of beach and trees through Baldwin State Park and in my exploration of the abandoned sugar cane factory. I wanted to capture the feeling of the wind and the waves and the ever-changing clouds and shadows of this beautiful place.
