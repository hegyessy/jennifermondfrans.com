Text: In this ongoing painting series of historical women scientists, I explore the idea of individual memory transforming history. Each portrait integrates the scientist’s work and includes a fictive letter about their work in science and the challenges they faced. History is made through memory. By reading the letter, you remember who she is and her work is remembered. History becomes recast.
