Description: 

Dear You,

In my homeland of China, women did not have the same rights as men when I was young. But my father believed in me, perhaps that’s why my given name means “courageous hero.” I went to his school that he and my mother operated, but when I was 11, I had to leave for a bigger city to continue my education. When I graduated, I taught school for one year before I could continue on to college. Upon completion, I realized I needed to learn more physics than China could provide and left for the United States.

I had intended to go Michigan, but my steamership landed in California and when I met physicists at the University of California in Berkeley, I changed my mind.

I studied under Ernest Lawrence, who would win the Nobel Prize for his invention of the cyclotron particle accelerator. And I met my husband who was also a physicist. After graduation, we went to the East Coast to find work. After teaching at Smith,  I became the first female instructor in physics at Princeton. This was more than 25 years before women could enroll as students.

In 1956, I was working at Columbia, when my colleagues asked if I could think of a way to test a basic law of physics. I did, and decided to carry out the experiment myself. I spent months just preparing and testing my specially-designed equipment.  

On the afternoon of January 15, 1957, the Department of Physics at Columbia called a press conference to announce the dramatic overturning of what had been considered a law of physics, known as conservation of parity. My colleagues, Dr. Tsung-Dao Lee and Dr. Chen Ning Yang won the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics but I was not included.

I did win the Medal of Science, the nation’s highest scientific award. And my book _Beta Decay_, published in 1965, remains the standard reference for nuclear physicists.

Learning, for me, was life-long. In my later research, I used advanced biophysics to study the molecular changes in hemoglobin associated with sickle-cell anemia. 

Love,

Chien-Shiung
