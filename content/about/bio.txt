Title: About

Statement:

In my work, I am interested in how we perceive the nature of the individual and the thematic ways that it can be communicated. Through the tradition of portraiture, I use written letters, binary code and performative process to create a relationship with historical concepts and contemporary life.

Using oil, acrylic, and water-soluble wax pastel, on paper, canvas, and wood, I paint with high-octane color. I like the tension between incongruent colors and juxtaposing complementary colors to create a visual emotional impact.
