Description: The sound recording is from the porch of where I was staying, a 1950s bungalow, right on the ocean. Recorded with binaural microphones at the day's end, it gives you 360-degree sound of the constant waves, mingled with crickets and ending with me entering the house, with the screen door shutting behind. I recommend over-the-ear headphones for full effect and you're welcome to download the sound to continue hearing the waves while viewing this series.
